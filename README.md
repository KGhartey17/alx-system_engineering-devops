# Bash Scripts Collection

This repository contains a collection of simple Bash scripts. Each script is exactly two lines long and demonstrates basic shell commands. Scripts are organized into folders based on their functionality.

Each folder has its own `README.md` file that describes the purpose of the scripts it contains.
